                    I enjoy programming, reading , writing prose and poetry and arts and crafts to name a few. My all time favourite books and authors include Harry Potter, The Prodigal Daughter, Murder on the Orient Express, Agatha Christie, Jeffrey Archer and .... I think I'll stop now. I hope you enjoy and do feel free to leave comments about my work! Thank you!
